I am a final year Electrical Engineering undergraduate at NUS, specializing in Industry 4.0. I am actively seeking opportunities to integrate Industry 4.0 technologies into power system engineering and smart grids. I am now working on a project of scheduling different kinds of energy storage systems (ESS) in the grids using optimization and scheduling algorithms.

My previous internships at Roland Berger, Ernst & Young Parthenon, and Oliver Wyman focused on various TMT sectors including sustainable energy, electric vehicles and robotaxis. Currently, I am also working as a product manager for a ESG fintech startup product at CNeutral.io (https://cneutral.io/), a leading ESG portfolio management terminal based in Singapore.
