I am a final year Electrical Engineering undergraduate at NUS, specializing in Industry 4.0. I am actively seeking opportunities to integrate Industry 4.0 technologies into power system engineering and smart grids. I am currently working on my final year dissertation titled *Enhancing Grid Resilience and Economic Efficiency through Spatial-Temporal Arbitrage of Mobile Energy Storage Systems (MESS)* under the supervision of [Professor Dipti Srinivasan](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/dipti-srinivasan/). My research interests span energy storage systems, grid resilience improvement, smart grids, sustainable energy prediction (generation and demand), as well as routing and scheduling problems.

My previous internships at Roland Berger, Ernst & Young Parthenon, and Oliver Wyman focused on various TMT sectors including sustainable energy, electric vehicles and robotaxis. Currently, I am also working as a product manager for a ESG fintech startup product at CNeutral.io (https://cneutral.io/), a leading ESG portfolio management terminal based in Singapore.
