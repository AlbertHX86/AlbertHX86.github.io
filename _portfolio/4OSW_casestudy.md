The selected case was commissioned by CGN Wind Power Co., Ltd. in December 2023 and demonstrated by Guangdong Hailantu Environmental Technology Research Co., Ltd. The marine area used for this project is 178.7534 hectares, with an investment of 6,264.04 million yuan.
The project site covers an area of approximately 47 square kilometers, with a water depth of 45 to 49 meters at the wind farm site, and the nearest distance to land is about 65 kilometers. The installed capacity of this project is 400 MW, with plans to construct 29 wind turbines, each with a capacity of 14 MW.
This project, planned by the Guangdong Provincial Energy Department, is an offshore wind power (OSW) project located offshore between Zhanjiang and Zhuhai. The overall project adheres to the national "14th Five-Year Plan for the Modern Energy System" and the "Interim Measures for the Administration of Offshore Wind Power Development and Construction." It is also constructed in accordance with the local energy regulations of Guangdong Province, including the "Guangdong Provincial Territorial Spatial Planning (2021-2035)," "Guangdong Provincial Territorial Space Ecological Restoration Planning (2021-2035)," and the "Jiangmen City Territorial Spatial Master Plan (2020-2035) (Draft)," as well as the management requirements of the ecological protection red line.
