Unlike provinces that began developing offshore wind power earlier, provinces that have only recently started large-scale development are placing more emphasis on offshore wind resources. They are establishing provincial platform companies to secure more offshore wind power projects. For instance, Zhejiang Province recently formed a new offshore wind power platform company named Zhejiang Marine Wind Power Development Co., Ltd.3 This company is owned by four state-owned enterprises (SOEs) under Zhejiang's provincial government: Zhejiang Energy Group (55%)4, Zhejiang Machinery & Electrical Group Co., Ltd. (20%), Zhejiang Port Investment & Operation Group Co., Ltd. (15%), and Hangzhou Iron & Steel Group Co., Ltd. (10%).
These four companies are all provincial SOEs. Zhejiang Energy Group, Zhejiang Machinery & Electrical Group Co., Ltd., and Hangzhou Iron & Steel Group Co., Ltd. are mainly held by the Zhejiang State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (90%) and Zhejiang Financial Development Co., Ltd. (10%), with the latter being fully owned by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance. Zhejiang Port Investment & Operation Group Co., Ltd. is owned by various municipal governments within Zhejiang Province, including Ningbo, Wenzhou, Zhoushan, Yiwu, and others. Although all are provincial SOEs, each of the four companies plays different roles within Zhejiang Marine Wind Power Development Co., Ltd. Zhejiang Energy Group primarily focuses on acquiring offshore wind resources and developing projects; Zhejiang Machinery & Electrical Group Co., Ltd. is more involved in supplying wind turbine units (being a major shareholder of Yunda Corporation); Zhejiang Port Investment & Operation Group is responsible for building and operating offshore wind ports; while Hangzhou Iron & Steel Group Co., Ltd. contributes high-performance materials and cost-control support for offshore wind projects.
The formation of Zhejiang Marine Wind Power Development Co., Ltd. comes at a time when Zhejiang is actively promoting the development of province-managed offshore wind projects. Two months prior, the Zhejiang Energy Bureau held a special meeting to push forward such projects in province-controlled sea areas. The meeting emphasized that the provincial energy system must follow the strategic guidance from the provincial government to strengthen coordination, plan scientifically, and advance orderly. The goal is to create a new brand for offshore wind development in Zhejiang. Thus, the establishment of this company has indeed enhanced the centralized coordination of offshore wind project development at the provincial level.

Before Zhejiang, several other provinces had already established provincial platform companies to gain access to province-controlled offshore wind resources and develop wind power projects, leading to a trend where provincial SOEs dominate offshore wind development. In July 2020, the Guangxi Guantou Offshore Wind Power Development Co., Ltd. was established. This company is owned by Guangxi Energy Co., Ltd. (60%), China Energy Engineering Group Guangxi Electric Power Design Institute Co., Ltd. (20%), and Guangxi Rural Investment Group Co., Ltd. (20%). Guangxi Energy Co., Ltd. is a subsidiary of Guangxi Investment Group, which is wholly owned by the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Government. Guangxi Rural Investment Group Co., Ltd. is a state-owned capital investment group based on Guangxi Water Conservancy & Electric Power Group and is also fully owned by the Guangxi government. Only the China Energy Engineering Group Guangxi Electric Power Design Institute Co., Ltd. is not held by Guangxi but is instead owned by China Energy Engineering Group Planning and Design Co., Ltd. Since its establishment, Guangxi Guantou Offshore Wind Power Development Co., Ltd. has participated in the bidding for offshore wind projects in Guangxi. In August 2022, the Guangxi Development and Reform Commission announced that the Fangchenggang offshore wind demonstration project (sites A, F1, and F2, with a planned total capacity of 1.8 million kilowatts) was awarded to a consortium led by this company. The company is also involved in the Qinzhou 900,000-kilowatt offshore wind demonstration project. In November 2022, Guangxi Guantou Offshore Wind Power Development Co., Ltd. established a subsidiary, Guangxi Guantou Beibu Gulf Offshore Wind Power Co., Ltd., to focus on the construction of Guangxi's first offshore wind project. The subsidiary is majority-owned by Guangxi Investment Group, with China General Nuclear Power Corporation holding 34%, China Resources Power New Energy holding 10%, and Guangxi Mingyang Smart Energy Technology Co., Ltd., China State Shipbuilding Corporation Wind Power Development Co., Ltd., and Envision Energy each holding smaller shares.

The deep involvement of provincial SOEs or platform companies in offshore wind development within province-controlled sea areas reflects the growing understanding of offshore wind power's significance by local governments. Offshore wind development involves a long industrial chain, which is crucial for local economic development and can generate steady fiscal revenue. Offshore wind investments are also significant and come with certain risks, requiring the participation of strong and responsible enterprises. In some provinces, where there are SOEs specializing in wind power development, turbine production, and port construction, combined with rich offshore wind resources, the formation of development companies from these SOEs allows offshore wind development to retain benefits locally while ensuring the quality of the projects. This strategy is beneficial for the provinces but may exclude central SOEs, out-of-province SOEs, and private companies, which can limit the potential for increased efficiency and cost reduction through market competition.
