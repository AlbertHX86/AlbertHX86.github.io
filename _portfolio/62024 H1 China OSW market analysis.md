According to a recent report by Wood Mackenzie1, global wind turbine orders reached a record 91.2GW in the first half of 20242, up 23% year on year. Wind developers invested a total of $42 billion globally, up 3% from the same period last year. It is worth noting that the Chinese market is an important part of the global wind power growth year-on-year. Of the 91.2GW of new global orders, 70GW came from China's domestic market, and another 5GW came from China's international market. As a summary, orders related to Chinese companies or markets have reached 82.2 percent of the global total. In addition, the order volume of India increased significantly by 69 percent, making the Asia-Pacific region account for 85 percent of the global order volume. In the data released by the agency, Envision led the global total order volume, followed by Yunda and Goldwind Technology, which both exceeded 12GW. Compared with China, Western manufacturers face difficulties. Their global market share fell to just 13% in the first half of 2024, with orders in markets outside China down 16%. Combined orders for the Americas and Europe were less than 10 GW, down 42 per cent year on year. In addition, orders for offshore wind fell 38% globally due to difficult economic conditions. The agency believes that inflation, policy uncertainty and competitive pricing of Chinese products in the West are holding back Western market activity.

In 2023, China's newly installed wind power capacity reached 75.9 GW. According to the aforementioned data, the total domestic and international orders in China for the first half of 2024 have already reached 75 GW, nearly matching the total installed capacity for the entire previous year within just six months. This indicates that the Chinese wind power market is still in a rapid growth phase. Given that the conversion rate from orders to installed capacity generally exceeds 50%, it is foreseeable that China's newly installed wind power capacity in 2024 will likely meet or exceed the 2023 level.
Wood Mackenzie attributes the competitiveness of China's wind power industry to its product pricing advantage, which aligns with the views of other foreign research institutions. Some analyses suggest that the rise of China's global influence in wind power is driven by intense low-price competition in the domestic market, combined with the general increase in the prices of wind turbines in Western countries, further enhancing China's competitive edge. However, at the same time, Chinese wind turbine manufacturers still face trade barriers in the European Union and the United States. These two markets are more mature in wind power development, and local manufacturers such as Vestas, Siemens Gamesa, Nordex, and GE Vernova possess strong service networks and long-standing performance records.
Although, so far, few Chinese wind turbines have been installed in the EU, the EU has launched investigations into Chinese manufacturers, claiming that subsidies from the Chinese government may distort competition within the EU market. Both Europe and the U.S. are also developing policies to encourage the growth of local wind power supply chains. The sheer scale of the Chinese market has significantly reduced turbine prices and led to the introduction of a series of new products, each of which pushes the boundaries of capacity and rotor diameter. In contrast, Western manufacturers have taken a different approach, prioritizing profitability over sales volume by exiting certain markets, reducing product portfolios, and protecting their profit margins.
