title: "AI for urban systems and smart grids: Integration of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to predict the demand for electricity in EV charging grids"
excerpt: "IW project worked with Prof. Dipti Srinivasan. In this study, deep clustering, LSTM networks, and collaborative filtering techniques were employed for clustering user behaviours and predicting energy demands in electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. Additionally, the user interface (UI) requires enhancements to better serve our primary stakeholders, the users and generators. Furthermore, the exploration of novel algorithms could offer substantial improvements in addressing these issues within the EV charging sector. This study emphasized the importance of utilizing data science and AI in urban systems."

As the world enters the era of electric vehicles, energy demand for charging is becoming a challenge for both the supply side and the user side. The complexity of the prediction problem stems from the intricate nature of user charging patterns and the need for advanced algorithmic development to address the prediction challenges [1]. In this report, we introduce an innovative approach to predicting energy demand in electric vehicle (EV) charging networks. A deep clustering technique is employed to extract user charging behaviours, which are then used as features in a novel Convolutional Neural Network-Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (CNN-BiLSTM) model applied to the ACN-Data dataset, comprising a wide array of EV charging sessions from Caltech in the United States.

This methodology, focusing on detailed problem analysis, shows improvements over existing algorithms. Additionally, to address specific user needs and usage scenarios, a collaborative filtering-based recommender system is proposed. This system aims to enhance user interactions by providing personalized recommendations, helping users make informed decisions regarding EV charging and energy consumption. By analyzing user data and patterns, the system can effectively offer tailored suggestions, improving user experience and decision-making efficiency in the context of EV charging.
