## What is YEAH
The hospitality industry  as a major pillar of the economy promotes tourism and local pan-services. However, hospitality professionals currently face poor information and difficulties in communicating with each other due to the lack of schools offering hospitality programs and the lack of communication channels. There is also a lack of channels for hotels (B&Bs, hostels, luxury hotels, etc.) to communicate their hospitality culture to the outside world.

As an association originated in Hong Kong, we have created a communication platform with nearly 400 hotel brands in Asia Pacific and around the world, as well as about 5,000 members in China alone. We provide a platform for communication through our associations and summits.

However, it is also necessary to promote the digitization of the platform, especially with the growing number of brands we work with and the growing number of members we have. So we created a product with key features such as forums, hospitality courses, DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), NFT Marketplace and more to provide a platform for users to communicate. We also provide a platform for hotels to communicate their hotel management culture through online courses, blogs and NFT.

## My team, as technical development
We have a huge group of colleagues working for YEAH. And as the lead of technical team, I am reponsible for developing our mobile app, website and forums. We also utilized Solana to build our NFT and DAO. Which encourages participants work and mine individually.
