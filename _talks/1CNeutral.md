**This is my work at CNeutral.io. Our startup has already entered the NUS Incubator and is being jointly nurtured by
the National University of Singapore and the Singapore Agency for Science, Technology, and Research
(A*STAR).**

## What is CNeutral
CNeutral is a world's leading ESG transition financial portfolio management platform and data provider. We utilize LLM to extract data from reports from SGX, Nasdaq listed companies focusing on their ESG development. We have a talented team lead by past experts in financial sectors, energy sectors and scientists from AStar. Our colleagues are from top-tier universities inclusing NUS, USC, Oxford, UIUC, Waterloo specializing in computing and LLM development.

## Collaboration
We had built connections with MSBA programme at UIUC. Out product will be used as one of their tools for the core modules. And we also have some students from the programmed joint us to collaborate to the project.

## Extract Data
Extracting ESG-related data is notoriously challenging. We leveraged advanced large model (LLM) techniques to analyze research reports and disclosure data to address this. As a result, we obtained nearly 1.6 billion ESG-related data points in Singapore alone, including information on carbon emissions, gender diversity in management, carbon footprint, and more.

We Utilized RAG (langchain) to extract ESG data accurately from unstructured data based on the annual reports from SGX listed companies.
